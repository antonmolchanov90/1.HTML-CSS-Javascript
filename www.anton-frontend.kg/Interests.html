<h1>My interests.</h1>
<p>I have a lot of different interests. Some of them are from professional field, some are just like hobbies, some concern my self-development.
Professional interests are IT and eCommerce, Marketing and Customer Service and, of course, Management (wish to become CEO or COO and rule people!).
Main among hobbies are:Football, Reading, Tourism (rarely) and, of course, Doing nothing (to rest and recreate).
Also I do believe that I should develop myself in major components (Mind, Body, Soul).
So I try to get more knowledgeable (read and learn new things), keep my body fit (morning exercise) and be thankful for all I have.
In time, I think I will have new interests, while old ones will be forgotten. But this is how it usually goes in the life on this mad planet!</p>
