<h1>My bio in brief.</h1>
<p>I was born on 2 of July, 1990 in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan. Went to school, when time has come in 1997. 1995-2005 were the best yesrs for sure.
And I'm full of nostalgia remembering those sweet, happy, bright, cheerful, kind, special days, which are alive only in my memory...
But the best times are ahead for sure.
Having finished school in 2008, I entered university and finished it (another one) in 2013 with bachelor's degree in management.
So not many years have passed since that time and now I'm about 27 (in two weeks). I have a nice job and always strive for balanced perfection in myself.
Life goes on and many more things are going to happen... BTW, if you click this text, it will DISAPPEAR! Yeah, I'm not joking, try!</p>
