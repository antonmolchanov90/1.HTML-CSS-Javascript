<h1>My Professional life.</h1>
<p>For now, I have been working for about 5 years (seriuos constant work). As some other human beings I also did part-time job when I was teenager.
I like to work and i brings me pleasure when I have results (both money and successful work fulfillment). To become a real professional and master of your work is a top notch achievement.
Some day I'll be a real PRO...
My current job is eCommerce specialist. I like eCommerce, it enlarges trading borders and gives opportunity to interact with people all over the globe.
My colleagues and boss are also good persons.</p>
